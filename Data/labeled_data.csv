They are essentially nanoscale sponges absorbing practically invisible lithium-ions at the thermodynamic and kinetic limits of the liquid soup of electrolyte transporting them and continue to excite both me for the science and an insanely rapid growing market for their capabilities and hope of a greener future.

In my current role as a Research Engineer, I get to directly study that magic by researching and developing South 8 Technologies' novel liquefied gas (LiGas) electrolyte ranging from testing various electrolyte formulations/additives to optimizing for specific electrodes or use cases. Concurrently, I help train and educate Research Associates on cell construction and electrochemistry fundamentals, as well as direct cell builds for various projects. I have experience using and interpreting data from cyclic voltametry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), conductivity measurements and general battery cycling (life cycle, rate and temperature capabilities) on Biologic and Maccor cyclers.

I've also had experience conducting UL safety testing, including thermal runaway, temperature, short circuit and overcharge/discharge testing of both modules and packs used in electric vehicles during my time at Flux Power. During my graduate studies, I also extensively studied lithium metal anodes, first authoring a paper on optical in-situ characterization of lithium plating and stripping, took multiple courses on electrochemistry and materials at UC San Diego and established and effectively managed a battery lab at SDSU.

My background in Mechanical Engineering has also provided a unique ability to critically solve problems through engineering and building practical solutions that are not always available commercially.

As I continue to grow in my career, I hope to keep learning about the world of electrochemical devices, research and develop interesting new technologies, educate and lead the next generation of innovators and researchers and ultimately help contribute to a greener and cleaner future for us all.",2.3835616438356166,Research Engineer,Tech,Academic,

* Student mentality when tackling anything data related 👨🏼‍🎓
* Wise among his years 👀
* Data modeling, engineering, and analysis 👓

I currently am a research analyst at Canterbury Consulting, and I have a passion for data science and anything analytics or data engineering-related. I write about some of my personal projects here: https://medium.com/@azaanbarlas

I have been interested in data analytics since 2018, being introduced through a mandatory business course I took about databases. I loved how challenging it was, so I ended up taking programming courses and learning about data science in my free time. 

I have extensive experience with Data Visualization as well and have done some automation in my recent work experiences. I love talking to people who are in this field, and I would love to learn more about how I can contribute positively to the world with these tools.

Aside from data analytics, I like learning about NFTs, as well as stocks and fixed-income. I also am a huge soccer nerd, especially in German and Italian soccer.

I'll ""BLUF"" (Bottom line up front) this by saying openly that I have ADHD, so my apologies for the tangential, wordy mess that will be most of what you read here.

I was born May 21st, 1992 in Richfield, Utah to my father Bret Baum and my mother Laurie Mitchell. I have two siblings, both sisters born June 19th, 1990 and September 6th, 1993. Raised within 30 miles of my hometown. Absolutely enjoyed/excelled at math (geometry, trig, algebra, calculus) and physics growing up. Would love to eventually go to college to get a degree in astrophysics, quantum mechanics, add infinitum. 

I love learning new information about almost anything and am a wealth of random knowledge, but my favorites are physics/software technology, the world, universe. I love learning how everything works down to a base/component level and almost whenever posed with a question about any of the above, I will try to find the answer by any means (books, YouTube, Google etc). If I need to know something to complete a task and don't, or just want to know more information, Google or YouTube. If I believe it to possibly be in the public domain and I don't know how something works or how to do something, I will without shame open Google and search until I find it, or sufficient searches have been done to show it is not easily obtainable through those channels in which case I will turn to a supervisor. Some would tell me to do that first, but supervisors have their own jobs and I feel it unfair to bother them with a question at my level if I couldn't be bothered to do the initial search for the answer myself. All that being said I don't believe everything I see or hear and will frequently try to find multiple sources dictating the same info before stating it with confidence. 

Mental Health issues may take my mind off track every once in a while but if I hyper-focus on a task, and am given the breathing space to execute, I will perform on average better than my peers. Some of my strengths would be attentiveness to detail, my adaptation to change, and my adequate timeliness on competing tasks. I'm usually in the top 2-3 performers when viewing technical job performance (servers, printers, workstations, switches/routers, basic IT/work related knowledge etc). My weaknesses would be effective direct (face to face) communication as I usually need to preface conversations before I have them, my inability to accept change for the sake of change, and my work-arrival timeliness as some of my health conditions make my sleep patterns variable, especially when on regular shifts.",0.0,Information Technology Support Specialist,Tech,,

I studied Chemistry, Polymer Science & Technology and Physics as principle subjects. In the chemistry special program, I had the opportunity to broaden my knowledge in all branches of undergraduate chemistry, which reinforced and solidified my intense interest in chemistry.

I also had the opportunity to complete an industrial training project as a chemist in training at Raigam Marketing Services (Pvt) Ltd, Sri Lanka. That training program gave me a lot of exposure to industrial chemistry while allowing me to further enhance my interpersonal skills.

While my early attempts were fairly lackluster, I moved quickly to Python, to Game Maker, to Flash and AS3, and finally to Unity, leaving a trail of passionate attempts at entertainment media in my wake. At Becker College I was able to develop my skills with industry experience, working on several commercial mobile titles with MassDiGI. My crowning achievement at Becker, as far as I'm concerned, was CyberDrive 2077 - I developed this game from scratch with a team of six at MassDiGI SIP 2018, continued on as producer and lead programmer to take it to launch, and it went on to become one of our most successful titles in the history of MassDiGI, with thousands of players and a 4.7 star rating on the App Store. 

Since summer 2019, I've worked heavily with Dejobaan Games, the award-winning developers of Elegy for a Dead World, Monster Loves You!, and AaAaAA!!! – A Reckless Disregard for Gravity. I helped bring Twenty Minute Metropolis, a 3D city builder released in March 2019, to a procedurally-generated 2D isometric prototype of a sequel, Thirty Minute Metropolis. My shader expertise, refined in my work with 30MM, helped Dejobaan take their visual style for Last Night on Planet Earth from Photoshop mockups to realtime Unity scenes. I'm currently working on a remaster of AaAaAA!!!, Dejobaan's 2009 hit basejumping game, putting my graphics programming skills to the task of updating the visuals to pristine 2020 quality.

I create campaign and content strategy that prioritizes connection and engagement. I believe what the audience needs should be the heart of content creation — as well as the heart of any decent marketing strategy. But while content can be the foundation of a good marketing strategy, it cannot replace a solid holistic marketing strategy. 

My favorite of the content marketing campaigns that I've orchestrated have found ways to engage readers above and beyond the average web experience. Interactive elements create online experiences that surprise and delight even those of us with the most screen time (guilty). I'm especially interested in finding ways to include gamification and specialized online products that entertain visitors on your site and keep them coming back regularly. After all, what's the point of marketing if no one is having any fun?

I rely on data insights to shape strategy that meets and exceeds company-wide goals and initiatives. I'm a fierce advocate of brand identity and voice, ensuring that every aspect of marketing aligns with the larger identity.

Temple was not my first choice for college but it was the correct one in the case of the Engineering College. The professors and students that I have met in my time at Temple have demonstrated to me that it is the place I belong. 

Being a student-athlete is one of the greatest challenges I have ever faced in my life and it has been nothing short of an amazing experience throughout college. It is through my participation in the men's crew team that I am able to excel both in the classroom and on the water through all of the different resources provided by Temple University.

	I like to create experiences with striking and immersive atmospheres with my skills in Game Design, Programming and teamwork, especially in video games, because for me this media is particularly suitable for immersing the user in an atmosphere.

	I love to be a part of a team and work with designers to give the best of ourselves and make a project real, I usally use my half designer - half developer point of view to spot future problems and avoid them in order to be as efficient as possible and facilitate a production.

	The design and development of AI in games interested me particularly, I find really interesting that we don't have to create an intelligent AI, but an interesting one that will challenge well the player, participate in the player immersion and in creating the identity of the game.

Whether it's revolutionizing an industry with a new product design or making our daily tools more efficient, more effective or just easier to use, engineering is at the core of the built world around us.  From a micro to a macro scale, we can choose what kind of world we would like to live in and we can use engineering to build the tools to turn those visions into reality.

These ideals are why I changed career paths after 10 years and I feel fortunate to love what I'm doing.  I thrive in a design environment where I can leverage my strong work ethic and project management experience along with my CAD and collaboration skills.

My academic interest can be understood through a drive to bridge science and physical, cultural history as a scientist whose interests are driven by a strong background in archiving and anthropology. As a Ph.D. student in physical chemistry at UC Santa Barbara, I am using the research field of gas phase spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to investigate cultural questions such as 'What did the ancient Mayans drink?"" and ""What does that knowledge tell me about their culture?"" Using modern analysis techniques with low limits of detection and high sensitivity, we are able to quantify drink residues in pottery fragments from the Mayan era in order to understand the class stratification and diverse trade networks.

Fields like anthropology or archeology often seek to understand the multifaceted complexities of defining and understanding a community through the analysis of personal experience, observation, written record, and conversation. Scientific tools and approaches often can support these narratives and expedite our narrative construction. I believe that scientific methods can serve as better tools to illuminate history and aid minority and disadvantaged groups commonly neglected in society’s narratives. 

The collaboration of analytical scientific techniques with experts in the fields of art and archeology to dictate the effect of these findings on cultural narratives, is the focus of my Ph.D. and hopefully of my larger career.",1.797260273972603,Lithography Engineer,Tech,,

I have 15+ years of experience in Business Development and Sales management within the Healthcare, Education, and Telecom/Networking industries.

During my tenure, my team consistently showed year-over-year growth to annual sales goals, reversed a precipitous downward trend in sales performance, and generated 54% improvements in team outcomes while operating under budget.  I generated productivity improvements among veteran salespeople, and I hired, trained and coached new team members to unprecedented sales outcomes within their respective regions.

As a member of the senior corporate leadership team, I worked with multiple department heads to address sales, marketing, business development, financial, operational, legal and human resource issues at the highest organizational level.  My people-focused approach unifies teams and creates consensus when tackling complex business issues, and drives positive change.

Creating efficiency through technology enables business to run in an agile, flexible manner around the globe, and this ultimately drives revenues. In short, my passion and expertise in technology, combined with an entrepreneurial drive, stem from my fascination for complex IT platforms. 

The scope of my sales experience encompasses building lasting relationships and working with corporate giants such as TYCO, Sunoco, Siemens and TE Connectivity in all aspects of building and deploying IT cloud solutions. Root cause analysis and digging deep are especially strong attributes of mine especially when it comes to working out multifaceted technical issues.

“Vision without execution is hallucination” - Thomas Edison

Great leaders possess the ability to transform and progress vision into reality.  They have the strategic capability and relentless motivation to inspire others to drive this vision to completion with them.

Human connection and passion are my drivers; they are the underlying basic human emotional needs that provoke my tenacious personality to consistently propel myself and those around me to grow.

These strong connections are what ultimately enable me to uncover problems and devise solutions.  By empowering those around me to step outside of their comfort zone, to ask challenging questions, to embrace their vulnerability and risk trying something new, I am able to help create a culture that drives organic growth from the inside out.

I came out of school with a degree in architectural engineering, and immediately went to work for a company producing software tools for the design and analysis of architectural lighting systems. Since those early days, I have steadily honed my craft to produce software of uncompromising accuracy, speed, and directness of usability.

The best tools are built by those who use tools. My early work in non-imaging optical analysis software was born of my work in designing life-critical lighting systems for the operating table. Today, I spend hundreds of hours a year engaged in digital astrophotography. This hobby has yielded dozens of techniques, algorithms, and usability ideas that feed my professional work of building sophisticated analytics to extract insight from geospatial imagery and related data.

As my career has matured, I have developed the skill of operating at higher levels of abstraction, evolving from software engineer to software architect. Today, my favorite challenges usually center on taking on a complex problem, identifying big picture patterns, and organizing an effective blend of new and existing technology to meet the challenge.  I have a gift for deconstructing and explaining complex problems clearly, but I also still enjoy getting down to the “nitty-gritty” details to solve those problems.

Michele Oswald, Ed.D.",Senior Consultant at Deloitte,Senior Consultant at Deloitte,"I have spent a lifetime ""learning"" about learning. From classroom teacher to head of school to higher education professor and administrator to working internationally for an education non-profit, I have learned a great deal about systems and program effectiveness. What works, what doesn't, why, and why not. Developing the skills to analyze individual, group, and system needs in order to design, develop, implement and evaluate curriculum and learning programs has been my focus. These roles and experiences have provided me the opportunity to better understand how people learn, what motivates them, how to support them, and the complexities of systems that influence how we support learning and development.

I achieve this by leveraging my engineering expertise, identifying faults, and utilizing rootcause analysis techniques. Additionally, I am adept at using cutting-edge tools and engineering design and analysis skills.
Most recently, for instance, as a Vehicle Evaluator at Roush, I exceeded my goal to find 3 faults per vehicle. I achieved this by carefully evaluating vehicle performance, conducting secondary research to keep common vehicle issues in mind, and overexerting the vehicle. My feedback and fault identification spurred critical quality improvements for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) prototype vehicles. Moreover, I also benchmarked vehicles for product validation and improvement here.

I am passionate about vehicle safety and design improvements. During my master’s in industrial engineering, I undertook a project to recommend product improvements for an airbag design. I approached this project using the Six Sigma Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) tool and quickly identified the propellant used for airbag deployment as the cause of product degradation. then recommended two viable solutions—a new and improved, tubular airbag design as well as an alternative material for the propellant.

My interest in vehicles and taking on new challenges extends to creating go-karts and racing cars and participating in competitions. I was part of a team that ranked in the top 60 out of 200 teams for a Formula SAE SUPRA event. For this project, I undertook the responsibility to resolve powertrain mounting issues. I also helped with the design and fabrication of the chassis. I also co-built a single-passenger electric go-kart operated via battery for the Eco-Kart Series.

Whether you realize it or not everyone faces challenges daily and how each person faces these challenges is what makes a person unique. I see engineering the same way, a challenge that someone needs to solve and that is the reason I found myself loving engineering. The word “Engineering” seems complicated and difficult to comprehend to most; however, for me, I see it as a means of expressing my creativity to the problem and the solution is the art.

College is similar in a way, we are given a set of problems from our professors to find our creativity to the problem and how each student approach the problem was different. These differences could lead to innovations that could greatly impact the world.

For my first professional project, I was allowed to develop an alternative to Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This project was conducted with a ground of using equipment that was available to us at the time. After a couple of months of design work, the prototype was complete. The Prototype was not at all what the client had hope for; nonetheless, the client was ecstatic with how it functions which had provided a new approach to the problem and from there a new potential to the finished product. This is what keeps me going, an endless cycle that will continuously create innovation.

The most important thing that school has taught me is that education is a means to an end, we must always pursue what each value as important. Most importantly, in my life, I see that I majored in mechanical and electrical engineering to broaden my creativity to approach the problem and this will help me become someone who is inspiring.",2.797260273972603,Hardware Developer,Tech,,

It was written in Indonesian and literally translated to “Tell Me Why”.  The book contained simple explanations to questions that children ask, such as “Why is the ocean so salty”, or “What is the difference between a fruit and a vegetable”.  Having this book read to me, ignited a sense of curiosity in me since I was little which has never died since.

Now how do I harness this curiosity?  I decided to focus my career in forensics engineering! Interweaving it with my interest in buildings and architecture, I specialise in understanding the root causes and mechanisms that lead to the failures of components and/or systems in the built environment.

Throughout my career, I have inspected over 300 distinct buildings, ranging from single-storey residential dwellings in the outback, to one of the highest residential apartment building in Australia.

The types of issues that I have diagnosed and repaired, includes the following (to name a few):

	- Interior and exterior waterproofing membranes
	- Combustible cladding
	- Building movements induced by reactive clay soils
	- Concrete reinforcement spalling 
	- Glazing elements
	- Lightweight cladding
	- Parking garages

I am not your regular engineer.  I'm a very visual person and love utilising sketches and diagrams to depict my ideas.  This includes hand-drawn details to computer models for clients and contractors alike.  I am naturally outgoing and have a high level of personal energy!  I love coordination, sharing experiences, and knowledge with others around me which makes me thrive in teams.   

When I am not crawling under buildings or hanging out the side of skyscrapers, I enjoy practicing and competing in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, cooking, and reading.

I've worked in early childhood education for 14 years and hope to continue my career in early childhood education until I retire. 

My interest in early childhood education first stemmed from my own educational experience. As a child, I was always encouraged to value my education and to never lose my curiosity to learn more about the world around me. That curiosity then helped me realize how important a child's education is in the early phases of life, which is why I am now a pre-school teacher. My teaching method also stems from this source of curiosity. At the early stages of childhood, all children are extremely curious about the world around them. I then foster that curiosity and use auditory, visual and linguistic teaching methods to help the child further develop the necessary skills they'll need in life and their educational journeys.

I am committed to my students and their families and hope to provide a safe and peaceful environment for them to learn and grow together.",12.972602739726028,Assistant Teacher,Academic,,

I have experience working in the web development and healthcare industries, where I specialized in identifying customer and user pain points and effectively communicating solutions. My full stack engineering education combined with my backend development experience allows me to understand the engineering mindset and language. This translates to my designs because I can consider their needs when making design decisions. My background in digital art and UI design certificate has given me a keen eye for aesthetics, and a strong foundation in design principles. This allows me to create accessible human-centered designs with a focus on the emotional needs of the user.

My key skills include:
- User Research (Competitor Analysis, User Interviews, Data Analysis)
- User Flows
- Wireframing
- Interactive Prototyping
- Figma
- Responsive Design
- HTML/CSS/JS

I am passionate about the intersection of technology, aesthetics, and user experience. It’s because of this passion that I am very thoughtful of my role as a designer. I believe what makes a designer great is having an experimental mindset and I am currently looking for career opportunities for entry-level UX/UI Designer.

Tianna Scozzaro,"Consultant I Facilitator at EnGen Collaborative, LLC","Advocate, Facilitator, Collaborator I Gender & Climate Resilience","A professional with more than 15 years’ experience in program management, donor relations, and stakeholder engagement. Background in gender equity and climate advocacy with the United Nations, U.S. Government and grassroots leaders. Experience in international development, strategic partnerships, event planning, and policy analysis.  

At the Sierra Club, I designed and launched the first-ever gender equity program at a national environmental organization.  We built a program based on the foundation that no matter one's gender we all deserve access to clean air and water, health care and safety. Within the first 18 months we garnered more than 100,000 dedicated online action takers from all 50 states. The program worked to protect the lives and health of women and LGBTQ communities so we can be resilient, healthy and effective leaders in our communities. This included access to paid family leave, reproductive rights, protection from gender based violence, toxics-free products, and integration of feminist principles into national and global climate policy.  

My previous work includes advocacy on the United Nations sustainable development goals, training governments and NGOs on women’s health and climate change in East Africa and Southeast Asia, and managing a portfolio of sub-grants totaling more than $500,000 across 8 countries. I served on the board of the Global Gender and Climate Alliance, as a program manger for a network of women environmental philanthropists, Rachel's Network, and worked as a policy fellow for the U.S. House Select Committee on Energy Independence & Global Warming in the aftermath of the 2010 BP oil spill. I am a regular contributor to Ms. Magazine, Huffington Post and Woodrow Wilson Center’s New Security Beat. 

My interest in global gender, health and environment was cultivated during my time in Latin America -- through volunteer work with USAID programs in Bolivia and the Ministry of Environment in Chile. During that period I also founded a dental health education program, Project Risa, which provided dental health education and a total of 10,000 dental supplies to children across the region, partnering with Engineers without Border, Caritas and others. 

My love for community organizing and event planning took shape in my own DC neighborhood. In 2016 I was elected as an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner (ANC 1C04) in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington D.C. where - for eight years - I also coordinated a large-scale music and arts festival, Adams Morgan Day, with 30,000 attendees annually.",2.3013698630136985,Consultant I Facilitator,Business,,

Few things that intrigues me and I want to learn more in the future are:

1. Data Science because this is what I enjoy learning, implementing and finding the information (inference) and building models (predictive models) that you cannot even imagine by looking just at the data. 

2. Quantitative Analysis because you feel confident and take decision(s) when you know the statistical insights from the data.

3. Machine Learning because the algorithms can do wonder by predicting almost anything (if not everything) from unseen data and you can apply ML algorithms to countless areas and field.

Working for a recruitment bureau gave me the oppurtunity to learn and experience a great variety of applications of piping and accessory welding. 
Being eager to always keep learning I achieved my piping-constructor education at Stork-Wescon in the half 90's. From that moment I developed my piping skills up to this very day on processing- and utility installations. 
From 2006 as freelancer under the name Quality Piping.
 That brought me where I am now : at Nutricia medical Nutrition, Zoetermeer as (independent)Utility Piping Engineer.

I have been continually recognized for playing a key role in achieving operational excellence in all organizational program/project budgeting, financial planning, and accounting to keep finances in line with expectations and revenues. 

After graduating with my degree in Accounting in 2003, I started out focused in accounting roles with different organizations before joining Pew Charitable Trusts in 2013 where I have been since. The early part of my career was influential in developing my skills in preparation for taking on the greater responsibilities with Pew. As an example, my expertise in MS Excel enabled me to create a new Excel financial recording system while I was with Q-Books & Tax Services that significantly increased overall efficiency while simultaneously reducing heavy workloads.

Since joining Pew Charitable Trusts, I have been promoted twice and continued to use my experience and knowledge to make impactful changes that have improved financial/accounting operations. Some highlights include:

I helped implement an automated expense module and train our staff on using it while I was the Coordinator, Payment Services that slashed paperwork by 70% and sped up expense reimbursement times by 40%.

Since being promoted to Associate Planning & Budget, I received the ""Partnership Award"" for my outstanding contributions on the US Public Lands project.

I also designed a Macro tool that has reduced the time coworkers spend on reporting salary allocations from 4 hours to just 30 minutes.

Perhaps my greatest strength I have exhibited throughout my career is my ability to quickly adapt to new environments to add tremendous value to operations.

I’m an Indian American television writer, comedian, and Air Force brat. I’m currently a 2020 BAFTA Breakthrough Honoree. I was recently a Freelance Writer on MIRA, ROYAL DETECTIVE, and former Staff Writer on ABC’s THE GOLDBERGS which is a show mostly about yelling, but in the 80s, so that’s like vintage and stuff. I’ve also written on two Netflix animated series.

I was in AFI’s prestigious MFA Screenwriting program but dropped out to join the prestigious 2019 Walt Disney Television Writing Program, because it paid a salary and I could go to Disneyland for free. I also studied improv/sketch at UCB and The Groundlings and as stand-up comedian I’ve been heckled at The Improv, The Comedy Store, Flappers, and a regular vegan restaurant gig of mine. I have a vestigial BA in Economics and a minor in Music from the University of Puget Sound. 

You may have seen my face as a cast-member on S4 of Food Network’s Worst Cooks In America, heard my voice as the longtime co-host and producer of the On The Page screenwriting podcast, and for you TV Writing nerds, you might’ve seen my social media smackdowns as head honcho of the troll-free 16k+ member LA TV Writers Facebook Group. 

In my somewhat, OK mostly hazy life before writing, I had nearly every job in the music business, from session and touring trumpeter/drummer to managing the music for Starbucks globally, when it was still good. 

My wife tolerates me, my two daughters humble me, and my two geriatric Maltese dogs rely on me as their nursemaid. 

If you wanna get a hold of me, hit me up here or contact my reps or BAFTA LA.

Well, I was determined to find out what those lines mean. So, I took my chances and jumped into programming train and did my bachelor’s and master's in computer sciences with emphesis  in digital media and security. I learned a lot about programming, game development, web development, network security, design illustration.

I have always been curious about the market, investment portfolios and finance in general. What recently interested me is the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) model and its assumption of the market being on the tangency portfolio. This is just a model, however its implications really intrigue me. 

Having learned an Indian classical dance form for over ten years has really helped me with discipline. I have been able to acquire skills like being focused, dedicated, having patience and communication skills. What I always appreciated, not just with regards to my dance, is criticism. I believe I am a good listener because I truly feel that everyone you meet knows something you don’t and it’s always beneficial to get to know yourself from different perspectives. There is always room for improvement and I usually push myself and everyone around me beyond limits and this is something that motivates me to take charge, and to mentor. 

My love for mentoring grew due to my constant urge of being surrounded by new people and helping them in any way that I can. Since I was kid, I have loved contributing to the society and have been a part of many different community service activities - from organizing weekly educational drives to organizing Relay For Life in my high school. As the founder of the Menstrual Hygiene Management program at the Robin Hood Army, I was able to spread awareness about a very important yet basic topic to the underprivileged. My main focus was to educate young girls and to remove the taboo associated with it.

I look for mentoring opportunities everywhere I go because I view them as the most efficient learning opportunities. Being a peer tutor for Business Analytics and Statistics has helped me to explore those subject areas even further. Microsoft Excel is my best friend and being a peer tutor significantly aided me when I was the Director of Finance at my sorority. 

Due to my liking of building connections and meeting people, I have also been fascinated by how business build relationships with different areas in the world, apart from just financial ones. I was effectively able to explore this inclination of mine further when I analyzed public relations while I interned at Bliss GVS Pharma. 

Looking ahead, I would love to explore all my interests being part of a financial institution. I aspire to continue my research on tangency market portfolios and would love to help people make the right decisions with investment portfolios!",2.468493150684932,BUS-K 303 Business Analytics Peer Tutor,Business,,

My financial career started at my parent’s grocery store, at the grand age of 9. I was supposed to sit at the front of the store and sell ice-cream. My official title was Ice Cream Fridge Manager. In all fairness, I ate more than I sold, but I did learn everything about cash management.

My dad also taught me about gross profit margins. Eat less and sell more, he said. But a good start nonetheless.

As a minority in Montenegro, oppression and injustice were commonplace, but my parents’ determination to keep the business going was what inspired me to learn all the financial know-how to keep the business and my family together. Nearly 2 decades later their strength continues to inspire me to help other businesses shine and continue on their mission to do good in the world.

If you are an entrepreneur ready for growth, are you able to answer the following questions: 

✔ Do you 𝗞now the company's cash needs six months out?
✔ Are you 𝗔ble to grow bottom line profitability 3-5% year over year?
✔ Do you know 𝗥eal project profit margins?
✔ Do you know 𝗘xact dollar break-even point?

-- I am able to clearly and succinctly articulate ideas to a target audience.
-- I have a unique ability to convert 'techspeak' into plain English and vice versa.
-- I do not care who gets the credit, so long as the problem is solved.
-- I am calm and collected in all situations and always thinking of the next step.

My professional interests include Application Integration, Integration Architecture, teaching and mentoring and Business Development.",6.052054794520548,Technology Principal,Tech,,

Being the mechanical lead of SAE Aero has taught me so much more than I ever would have expected about engineering.  I get to experience first hand that engineering is a social and collaborative field, and that your projects are only as strong as all the people involved.  No one person can design, test, and manufacture great engineering tech, and I try to show my team that all the work that they do is important.   

This is one reason why I love engineering.  Great engineers often are stereotyped as the socially awkward, quiet genius, and while many of us may be a bit socially awkward, I have learned that true engineering is not just one person quietly punching numbers on his calculator, it is many people who work hard and work together to accomplish their goals.

Technology is so amazing to me, and I love being involved in this field.  My goal for the future involved in amazing projects.  That is why I am interested in Aviation and Aerospace.  I want to be part of something that takes us off of the ground.  It is mind bending to me how humans have been able to create technology that even leaves our atmosphere, and it would be my dream to be a part of that.

I am the kind of person who loves to learn, and loves a challenge.  Some of my hardest classes in my educational career have been the classes that I tend to do the best at, and I would not have been able to do it without collaborating with my piers.  Conquering difficult challenges, as a group, to me that is engineering.",3.1315068493150684,Mechanical Design Engineer,Tech,,

When trust and exceptional attention to detail are required, call me! I have been a full-time licensed managing broker since 2004 helping hundreds buyers, sellers and investors successfully transition to their next home or property.
I was presented with the ReMAX Platinum Award in 2007, an honor given only to the top 1% of ReMAX agents worldwide. I am also a member of the ReMAX Hall of Fame. Both of these awards represent thousands of hours of time spent working tirelessly for my clients, helping them achieve their real estate investment dreams. I wouldn’t have it any other way!
I hold a degree in accounting from Seattle University and have held a CPA (Certified Public Accountant) designation since 1986. This background empowers me to guide my clients with sound financial advice – regardless of whether you are purchasing a home, a commercial property or are in need of a credible analysis of your property’s current market value. In addition to being a REALTOR® and a certified commercial broker, I’ve made a point of dedicating myself to being an expert in real estate. I have earned numerous certifications, far beyond what you will find in a typical agent.
Beyond my meritorious work and professional education, there is one more thing that I bring to the table as your real estate agent which you should not overlook: I have worked and lived in the Seattle area my entire life. I really do know the Puget Sound area as only a true local can. Growing up in Lynnwood and Seattle has impressed on me what a unique and incredible place this is to live.

Whether it was a business or an individual, technology or strategy, work or leisure, that sense of achievement is unmatched.

Technology and sports are where it all started: You should've seen the huge smile on my face winning my first match, the exhilaration I felt when someone I helped wins the match, the awe when meeting the new IBM XT, and the happiness and wonder when playing with the Commodore 64.

First I see potential, then I start immediately thinking of ways to achieve that potential, finally, I try to make it a reality and strive to take it a step further…

I started my professional career writing software and building networks while selling ads and event tickets on the side. Freelancing forced me to find effective ways to manage my customers' projects and guided me towards learning the principles of project management. This presented more opportunities to me and I started to withdraw from technical work and focus more on project management.

However, I needed more: I needed to talk to more people, to meet new people, to have the flexibility to do business in and out of my desk! That's when I moved to sales.
Yet, nothing topped that exhilarating feeling I got every time I assist or coach a team member - which lead me to where I am today.

Are you ready to transform your business and evolve it to the next level? Achieve more with less? Or, perhaps, diversify your business venues?
Do you feel let down by the way business is being conducted or by some unproductive traditions in the organization?

She sells to neighbors, friends, and family. She is assertive, driven, and naturally comes in first for candy and magazine sales amongst her peers every year. Picture a child that naturally recruits others for her cause and is motivated by results. Now picture that child as an adult. She’s a leader and a manager, cultivating and expanding on the same basic skill set she recognized within herself early on.

The facts are these: The story above is a true story. That child was me. The curiosity and desire to learn, grow, and contribute to a “big picture” never ended. As an adult, I do what I love every day. I’ve learned that I can accomplish more by motivating others in a team setting. By understanding the difference between sales and marketing, I am able to optimize the relationship between the two. I develop sales processes, strategies, scripts, marketing plans, and promotions. I’m heavily involved with online marketing, SEO, pay-per-clicks, content creation, and the overall creative process.

Most importantly...

I am constantly searching for opportunities to increase business growth, the development growth of the team I’m supporting, and the personal, professional growth of myself.",8.717808219178082,Independent Marketing Consultant,Business,,

The first was a costume contest, and the second was estimating the number of candies in jars placed around the office. Because of winning both contests I was now known around the office, and I can thank both my ingenuity and my strength in mathematics for it.

I continue to apply these skills in both my professional and personal life. I love to think out of the box and find solutions that optimize work efficiency as well as build collaborative team efforts. This is what I have learned about myself:

I can successfully identify and resolve complex report discrepancies because of my strong investigative skills, accuracy, and logic.
➣ I make decisions not only off instinct but through data input and analysis.
➣ I quickly comprehend and utilize systems and procedures.

I can lead and build collaborative environments, while continuously improving through constructive feedback.
➣ I strategize and execute ideas to foster team-growth, nourish corporate rapport, and enhance my personal work ethic.
➣ I do not shy away from beginning conversations but also know when it is time to sit back and listen.

I strive to always educate and improve. 
➣ I use my curiosity to invest in learning why daily tasks are crucial to the bigger picture.
➣ I stay calm when faced with adversity.
➣ The only bad question is the one not asked.

I enjoy meeting new people and gaining diverse perspectives. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat on report reconciliations, team value, or if you’re curious on what my winning costume was…

I have an innate desire to create and bring my ideas to life which had led me to pursue a music degree, but my skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, and logic drew me to pursue a career in tech as well. I am ambitious and have a deep-rooted desire to perform exceptionally in any job I am involved in. 

I want to make lasting change in the world through tech. My personal projects are typically fresh and unique. I find so much joy in developing projects that don't exist yet. It is that kind of creative and innovative thinking where my work shines the brightest. I am especially drawn to full-stack development as I am someone who desires to understand a feature inside and out. 

Thanks to my success in music I have had the opportunity to travel a great deal. In the summer of 2012, I was apart of a troupe of guitarists that toured Germany. I toured Cuba in the Spring of 2017 with a quartet. In the spring of 2018, I studied a semester abroad in Italy where I lived for four months. While in Italy I was able to visit Spain, France, Germany, and Ireland! It was thanks to these opportunities that I developed a very confident sense of self, an appreciation for travel, and a love for people.

• Validating control laws and digital filters written in embedded C and tested in PSIM before deploying to DSP.

Converter topology deployment:
• Developing driver solutions for IGBTs, employing VCE saturation protection scheme using pulse transformers and high slew rate OP-AMP ICs for fast gate turn-on and turn-off times, without degrading the integrity of software deadband.
• Troubleshooting power device failures and taking necessary action in drive circuits along with writing immediate stopgaps in DSP in case of component scarcity or man-power absence.

Analog instrumentation and embedded target:
• Developing instrumentation for AC and DC signals for closing feedback control loops, comparator-based protections, DSP sampling, zero crossing techniques and grid synchronization.
• Prototyping common-ground and galvanic isolation-based circuits with trade-off between response times and signal quality, employing active filtering circuits and isolation amplifiers.
• Bare metal coding with assembly instructions SPI, I2C and UART for reading multiple Digital Inputs (DIs), energizing contactors for disabling soft-start (and other DOs), storing time stamped alarms in EEPROM for communication with master control unit or similar slave power modules in a redundant n+1 parallel power supply system and for RTCs.
• Writing drivers for industrial communication protocols like MODBUS RTU over RS485 lines. Also learning to build MODBUS RTU to MODBUS TCP-IP converter.

DSP algorithm validation and coding:
• Developing and optimizing controllers in assembly language based on forward, backward and bilinear transformation of analog compensators with varied integrator saturation schemes.
• Writing floating point FIR and IIR filters in 32-bit DSPs based on bilinear transformation with frequency warping of analog filters for filtering signal with ground bounce noise sampled at 2xFSW, between ringing intervals.",2.468493150684932,Graduate Student Research Assistant,Academic,,

Hi! I’m Aakash.

I went on to pursue Industrial Engineering for my passion for supply chain and managing New product operations. I still remember entering the industry with no predominant knowledge and climbing the ladder now to successfully optimizing budgets from thousands to millions. It feels like Magic!

I enjoy my job which involves research and development, procurement, strategic collaboration and negotiation for huge projects with top clients and business gurus and other related things that come along the way. 
I have that thing in me called ‘Jugaad’- Getting things done.

And this is what keeps me up at night, the quest to learn still thrives with the Industry having a lot more to offer. There’s certainly more to learn and yet more problems to solve. And for this, I’m very thankful.
When I’m not engaging with work; I’m cooking, volunteering, reading books, and improving my photography and photoshop skills. I spark joy in meeting new people and hearing new perspectives.

Have stories to tell, not stuff to show."" 

I am a fourth-year student at Rutgers - New Brunswick double majoring in Marketing & Business Analytics and Information Technology. I am seeking a role to apply my previous experience effectively. 

Previously, I interned at a school for students with Special Needs and completed a Capstone project that helped the students smile, one day at a time. In my free time, I am currently learning how to play the ukulele and I love to sing. As a member of my previous choir, I am thankful to have been able to accompany them in performing at Carnegie Hall in New York City and in Denmark. Also, the connections I made and skills I compiled as a Director of hackBCA are invaluable, and am proud to say I have joined the HackRU Team as Director of Finance as well! Working directly with sponsors, as well as managing the questionnaire email, budget sheet, contracts, and invoices lead to an entirely new world of hackathons. 

One of my favorite parts as Director of Finance and Legal Operations was managing my team to work out problems between team members, settling disputes with companies, and finalizing legal documents that helped create such a wonderful event. I feel lucky to have acquired comprehensive skills to help me in many aspects of life having been a coach and captain of Cricket and Volleyball teams.

The Capstone project that I worked on senior year of high school was an unforgettable experience. Our group of 5 created a working project that uses intensive Artificial Intelligence technology, and linked it to a Humanoid Robot to recognize special needs students and hold a lengthy conversation with them. Getting to know the students on a very personal level opened my eyes and provided me with a whole new perspective of the world.

At the end of the day, I aspire to be the happiest, most successful, and best version of myself.",4.967123287671233,Director of Finance,Business,,

My collaborative personality and persevering attitude have allowed me to adapt to any environment and get along with multiple personalities to conduct business and get the job done successfully.

I believe in all the advanced technologies(hardware and software) we have now and we will have in the future but human power will remain the central player. Here are some lines about myself: I studied physics at the University of Birzeit in West Bank, Palestine. I completed my dissertation in 2004 at the University of Lausanne with the Nobel Laureate, Jacques Dubochet. During my PhD work, I developed and applied cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) on various biological specimens to study macromolecular complexes such as intercellular adhesion junctions in situ. In 2005, I moved to the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg and worked as a postdoctoral fellow, where I continued to investigate the molecular structure of human epidermal desmosomes using cryo-electron tomography of vitreous sections. In 2010, I moved to Bonn to take up a position as a research group leader at German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in cryo-electron microscopy and tomography of synapses in mouse retina. There, I spent much time doing image processing and have learned a lot of new techniques such as sub-tomogram averaging and use them to unravel the molecular architecture of retina photoreceptor rhodopsins and specialized synapses, termed ribbon synapses. Since January 2018 I am working at Center for Cellular Imaging and NanoAnalytics (C-CINA) in Basel with Henning Stahlberg where we are investigating neurodegeneration using advanced biophysical and imaging techniques. I am back again to Switzerland to the true joy, to the lab bench and experiments like it was in Lausanne more than 15 years ago; it is just much more fun!",5.8,Research Associate,Academic,,

As both an undergrad and a grad student I was pushed and challenged to perform highly, and I relished the challenge. 

Montana Tech allowed me to channel my interest in the various aspects of electrical engineering: from Power Systems and Control Systems to Electronics and Wireless Communication, and allowed me to create, collaborate, and complete a wide range of projects. 

Now that I’m graduating soon I’m looking forward to the next chapter in my life; a career where I can apply my passion for my field and be an active and valuable contributor.

When I’m not working on a project or hunched over a textbook, I’m usually off-roading in the mountains, or in my garage working on fixing and restoring an older truck (Love those late 60’s Chevy’s). I enjoy watching sports, especially football, play video games, and travel whenever I get the chance.

Healthcare is an ever-changing field in which we are constantly learning new things. In my opinion, it is one of the beauties of the field itself. Alongside the continuous learning, a big motivator for me is building personal relationships with patients along with coworkers in the hospital setting.

From my experience, I know that most of these patients may not have much going for them or they may be in a tough spot in life. No matter their position, it is the responsibility of a healthcare professional to make them feel as if they have come to a safe place where they will be catered to and looked after 100%. Those relationships are extremely valuable to me and that is the main reason why I want to serve others in healthcare.

Although I plan on going into the administrative side of healthcare instead of the medical, I believe that I can still touch the patients’ lives through proper staffing and policies. I want to get to a top executive position one day and build a team full of caring people whom I know will serve our patients to their every need.

Healthcare should not be looked at as a business but unfortunately, money is held above peoples’ lives.

My interest in this field is Educational Counseling with an emphasis in Academic Advising for college students preferably at a four-year University.

On a personal level, I want to continue my relationships with those people I am close to and begin a life. I think I would make a good hire because I am willing to learn and immerse myself in all the experience that an employer has to offer. I understand that in order to be a successful leader you must be able to follow and I am a willing follower.

In summary, I offer leadership, loyalty, facilitation, preparation and an unstoppable work ethic on and off the court. This began early, exploded in high school and has carried on through college.

I later attended SCS business school and the Art Institute of Philadelphia to hone my craft in multimedia. Upon graduating, my partner and I founded Neshee Publications, a very successful self-publishing company that helped several authors make their dreams a reality with a published book. I was also the co-founder of Infinite Magazine and several other publications that featured many talents that included Erykah Badu, Salt n Pepa, Miasha and a host of others.

As a business and financial manager, I continue to guide and advise several multimedia talents in the way of their career with contract negotiations, overseeing business deals, and arranging meetings that landed the talent amazing collaborations with businesses that include BET, xoNecole, InStyle, and more. 

As the Senior Editor of The USA Reviewer, I oversee the content creation process and manage junior editors. My team and I proofread text, and improve its clarity, spelling, and punctuation to create clear and concise stories that are real, thought-provoking, and impactful to the community.

Interacting with different customers daily, I did everything I could to figure out what they needed. My ultimate goal was to make sure they were happy and satisfied with what I did for them.

I am a very analytical person. Volunteering at my church in multiple positions has helped develop this skill. I often help with managing my churches finances, which requires me to compare past data to current data. I will often create graphs or table to help with analyzing this data, and to make it easier for others to understand. When dealing with any kind of data you can never be too thorough, so I always double check my work to make sure everything is correct. Analyzing data is often times people least favorite part of business and marketing, but for me its my favorite.

Merchandising is one of my strongest skills. I began in the clothing department at sears, so my main focus was merchandising. My goal was to get the product to the floor quick. I was in charge of the men’s department at the time, so I always made sure everything was done in my area, and then would go help others with their departments. I always made sure my metrics stayed positive and never stayed negative if they did drop that low. Whenever my department was struggling, I would revamp the entire department to help it appeal to customers once again and boost sales. When I was not working in my own department, I was helping manage other departments in the store and helping them meet their goals.  Rebranding and reorganizing the departments, always made a big difference.

Aaliyah's interest in engineering began with a trip to Athens, Greece in 2009 when she was competing in track and field at the International Children's Games. Upon exploring the city, she found inspiration and motivation among the ancient buildings that remained standing after centuries of varying environmental factors. With this inspiration, she went on to enroll in the Engineering Academy offered by her high school where she learned skills such as manual technical drafting and various AutoCAD programs. In addition, further motivation was derived from her desire to explore her passion in the STEM field that students from underrepresented communities do not pursue as often due to lack of resources and support.

With that inspiration and motivation, Aaliyah made sure to have a part in giving back to UC Berkeley's surrounding community by joining the Black Engineering and Science Students Association on Berkeley's campus. One of Aaliyah's goals is to travel around the world and share her experiences as a growing and developing Civil Engineer, especially with more underrepresented communities. Her goal is to explore methods and technologies to improve transportation around the world that would help bring society into a more renewable, preventative, and progressive era. She hopes that through traveling and understanding the human experience from people of different communities that she can provide the best technology and resources possible for life improvement.",5.052054794520548,Design Engineer,Tech,,

I always thought my dream was to be a doctor, it was always my plan to end up doing that even though I was double majoring with computer engineering. But little did I know it was only a distraction from my real dream, the one that started as a young kid playing video games. I decided to create my own game, which introduced me to the world of computers and programming so early on because it was what I needed to make my own games. Thus started my journey and passion for coding, working on small projects starting with Visual Basic as my first language and working my way to being a Software Systems engineer. 

I love viewing reality as a video game, and programming helps me to better understand it and create the reality I want very easily and simply. It is an extremely satisfying and beautiful art, turning simple characters into creations like my own video game, applications that change the whole world, and that just scratches the surface with the infinite possibilities available.

My specialties include problem solving, quickly learning new skills and programming languages, systems design, computer systems and Linux kernel programming. However as you know video game development always comes on top ;)",2.3013698630136985,Research And Development Specialist,Academic,,

Early in my educational career, I decided to pursue a Master’s Degree in Cross-Cultural teaching, because I knew it would give me a perspective on educational pedagogy that emphasized compassion, equity and diversity as its center guiding posts. 

Now that I’m a doctoral student in educational leadership for social justice, my goal is to use my research skills to improve programs and create systems that address the needs of all our teachers and students. My dissertation topic focuses on teacher trauma, healing and resiliency. This is a very personal and important topic for me because it seeks to understand the learning context teachers navigate and how we can create systems of support and encouragement. As teacher induction program assistant, I intend to use my research skills to implement trauma informed practices as guiding principles for creating teacher centered supports.

My 24 year educational tenure in public schools across California,  has taught me that the most important ingredient in creating healthy and sustainable programs is to listen to teachers and grant them the opportunity to have a say in the decisions made for their classrooms. Teachers need to feel empowered, and when they do, they thrive.  This is why it is so important to implement frameworks of healing, justice, compassion, restoration and love that prioritize the needs of our educators. 

As an educator leader,  I’ve volunteered for several committees and adjunct leadership roles that have further fueled my interest in transitioning into educational leadership positions. Among some of these roles include: Dual Language Chair, Union Representative, Curriculum Committee Adopter, Units of Study Lead, after school Math Coordinator, Science Coordinator, Technology Presenter (Riverside Consortium),  ILT member, Technology Committee Member and EL grade level lead. Serving on various platforms, while teaching in the classroom, has applied my perspective on how educational systems work from the ground up. It is this same interest in leadership that led me to pursue a  preliminary administrative credential at UCI. Through my training, I learned the complexities and intricate work administrators do in order to keep a school and programs moving forward.",5.219178082191781,4th Grade DLI Teacher,Academic,,

My career began in radio in 2004 when I was still a junior in college. I was hired to conduct advertising sales and I would be ALLOWED to call play by play for high school football, basketball, soccer and baseball games for a small 1,000 watt day time only AM radio station in Blacksburg, VA.
I developed in that career for 12 years landing in 2011 as the Sports Director for Cumulus Media in Myrtle Beach, SC. I was the program director for two sports talk radio stations and the host of our morning drive talk show. I called myself a sports broadcaster but I sold my own clients ads on my show, planned events, wrote social media posts, developed websites and developed content every day designed to draw in listeners and sell them my sponsors products. I was a digital marketing professional in the making and didn’t even know it.
In 2016 I transitioned to a brand marketing strategist role with Curtis Media in Raleigh. Then I decided to really roll the dice in life and accepted the Marketing Manager role for the Carlson Center in Fairbanks, Alaska.
I was now writing website content, placing ads on social media and Google, overseeing video production for online consumption and planning large scale events.
Nobody had ever really taught me much about digital marketing, I was kind of learning on the fly. So in 2019 I enrolled in Rutgers Business School’s Masters of Science in Digital Marketing program.
I graduated in May of 2021 earning a degree with honors, magma cum laude, with a 3.95 cumulative gpa. 
While that was happening, Covid wrecked my career as a marketing professional in the arena space. I thought to further enhance my skill set that a digital marketing agency made sense and I landed an amazing opportunity at Avalaunch Media in Lehi, Utah.
Today I handle management and digital strategy for clients all over the world, plus I’m working towards becoming an adjunct professor of digital marketing, a goal of mine with obtaining my masters degree.
If I can offer you advice on your marketing strategy, send me a message and let’s talk!
I’m a competitive triathlete and marathon runner. My 2022 race schedule includes the Salt Lake City Marathon, Ironman Oregon 70.3, and Ironman Washington 70.3. I enjoy skiing and hiking in the Utah mountains as well! I love dogs, rescues in particular, and have two black lab rescue pups.

I am a consultant in Deloitte’s Engagement Financial Advisor (EFA) practice where I advise clients on project economics, track financial KPIs, and provide opportunities for financial growth and success. I’m truly grateful to be working at one of the largest consulting firms on the planet. Deloitte is extremely close to my heart. I thrive in situations where I need to find quick and quality solutions, and at Deloitte I have the opportunity to showcase my passion and ability at the highest level. 

Previously, I worked as a financial analyst for the The Home Depot’s infrastructure engineering portfolio where I helped bridge strategy with financials by tracking non-labor expense activities and manage budgets. I was blessed to work for a manager that helped increase my knowledge in financial analysis and user experience - both of which factor to the overall success of my role in finance. 

In addition to my work, I am also passionate about giving back which I believe contributes to both my professional and personal lifestyles. I am proud to share that I have 15+ years of volunteer experience. I am fortunate to have worked on diverse projects with the Aga Khan Foundation USA since I was age 13! Additionally, I have been in-charge of multiple sports tournaments through the Aga Khan Youth & Sports Board where I brought value from a logistical standpoint, as well as financially. My greatest accomplishment, when evaluating our efforts as a team, is being able to recognize the joy and convenience that we were able to provide young adults and their families. 

Donating my time and energy for the common good has directly added value to the morals and beliefs that my parents instilled in me at an early age. 

When I am not focused on my quality of work, I am focused on spending quality time with my family & friends.

“Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more.”

Film Endeavors:
Aamir is currently working on a film script that is centered around the lifestyles of troubled youth, yet focuses on unexpected, but positive outcomes.   

The Musical Approach:
Skrill Gates focuses his lyrics on the realities of life in the streets versus the over sensationalized façade of the entertainment industry. His music documents the untold stories of young men growing up in the ghetto and the choices they are required to make to survive. Although Skrill Gates has worked with many established artists and producers such as Aaron Carter, he prefers to allow his “Reality Music” sound to speak for itself. 

Community Ties:
With his program, Project A.A.M.I.R., he seeks to touch the lives of young men in crisis who need support and skill development with managing anger, overcoming negative self-esteem, racism, and peer pressure. Aamir's approach to counseling uses real life situations and examples, which can sufficiently build the skills needed to survive in a society that seeks to solve the issue of troubled adolescents with incarceration.",18.312328767123287,Artist/Partner,Entertainment,,

I taught middle and upper school Latin for 11 years in RI, NV, CO, and NJ. In my last year of teaching, I attended an after-school programming class taught by two senior boys (Jonathan Tang & Oliver Barnum, to whom I am very grateful for their instruction & inspiration!). I started working on a web app that would allow my students to practice Latin forms and grammar. It changed the way I was able to differentiate instruction in class and the way students were able to practice the material independently outside of class.

I have spent my whole career in the manufacturing industry.  Here I learned that the smallest detail can make or break a project.  I was taught a hands-on approach to problem solving.  I started working production lines at 18 years old and there I was taught the smallest change can impact a project in exponential ways.  This skill carried over as I started working in Tool & Die designing and building tools for production - where even the smallest detail matters.

While I was beginning my career, I attended college to earn my degree in Information Systems; a passion I hold dear.  I have installed complete networks from the ground up, taught myself how to deploy and run VoIP systems, and troubleshoot hardware issues.  Deployed CCTV systems from the older RG style to the now IP based systems.  I love to watch networks grow and how the different systems interconnect, how to secure them, and how to scale them across multiple campuses.

My experience thus far in my life has led me to be able to analyze problems from many different sides, from mechanical, to technological, and product interactions.  I have led small teams in production all the way to my current position leading several diverse crews in reaching the same goal.

Even when I go on vacation, I will view the building I am staying in admiring how the APs are deployed, what CCTV systems are deployed and their coverage, and how the building mechanicals works.

My own career path has been anything but linear. Once I was first introduced to the world of careers, I saw the gaps in career education among my peers but also myself. I had been thinking there was only one way to be successful, and I would have to struggle through it alone. But life is not linear; it is chaotic, as one decision can alter your entire reality. There is not one ""right"" way to enter a field and obtain a position. Not one major leads to one job for your entire career. The thought of being able to educate someone through the chaos of life while guiding them along the journey to finding a career path, provides me with fulfillment as I have made a true difference in their life. Advising a student on what courses best match their interests and exploring careers related to a major may seem small, but that aid may help them feel confident enough to apply to new positions or even achieve their dream job. Seeing the success of the individuals that I have mentored and advised makes all of the research, education, and planning worth it.

Her passion is employing art in group settings as a hands-on metaphor for exploring life. She works primarily with high school students and offers seminars at women's retreats. Aarah's favorite work is with at-risk youth. ""They have so much raw passion, and it's just overlooked so much of the time,"" she explains. ""There is nothing more rewarding for me than witnessing how peers can cultivate trust and foster relationships through art-making experiences."" Aizman engages her students in a wide array of mediums, demonstrating how to identify and respect each medium's own unique set of strengths, limitations, and vulnerabilities. 

Aizman has a B.A. in Art & Community with a focus on the practical implications of the psychological and spiritual nature of creativity.

Growing up, I wasn't exposed to the endless opportunities the music business has to offer. As a self starter, I found my way in during my time at Hampton University. By writing for various media companies and blogs like The Source Magazine & Sway's Universe, I eventually landed a role as a college rep for Sony Music Entertainment, where it all began. 

My experience at Atlantic Records, Culture Creators and currently, EQT, has allowed me to lead emerging and developed artists' campaigns primarily focusing digital & influencer marketing and social media growth, traditional rollout planning, event planning, precise communication, creative sourcing/ideation, video production and management. 

I love being immersed in fast paced environments. I enjoy working cross functionally with many label teams and managers as we drive towards common goals to make our artists successful and at the top of their game. 

By using social media like TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, Triller, as well as staying informed on daily entertainment and music news, I'm able to advise on cultural trends and provide insight in real time to my counterparts.",1.7123287671232876,Marketing Director,Business,,

I bring with me six years of work experience in operations, compliance, sales training, company-wide policy creations and government relations. I worked with Columbia Southern, a leading online university in the higher education industry, as an outside sales representative for six years. Most recently, I was a sales representative in the Austin office for Signpost. At Signpost I worked on a team that provided CRM solutions to small and medium sized businesses; using my sales expertise to introduce opportunities and enact results with clients. Currently, I am looking forward to growing my sales, business development, and marketing talents.

During my employment with Columbia Southern University I was given opportunities to improve each region I was assigned to by increasing enrollments from sales and marketing strategies I had to personally develop. In each of the three assigned regions, I was able to increase my sales confidence by encouraging new students to enroll in courses while still improving student retention, enrollments and graduation rates for the university in those specific regions. At Signpost, I averaged 200 minutes on the phone and dialed between 150-180 times per day. Recently, through Software Advice I worked as an advisor to C-level employees needing software solutions to improve business processes. Throughout my career as an account executive I have maintained a 3/1 sales ratio.

A unique identifier about me is my customer service mind-set, which comes from having a 10 year background in volunteer service for local communities that I have lived in and national organizations that I have served in (Civil Air Patrol and Christian Hope Resource Center.) I have a seasoned ability to take the lead and the back seat as a team player. Being a go-getter, I bring a positive energy to any role I serve in and I will use it to my advantage while serving your organization.Timepiece",0.1671232876712328,Sales Advisor,Business,,

As an enterprising, passionate, enthusiastic reporter, I break down complicated ideas so that ten-year-olds and grandmothers alike can understand what's going on in the world around them. I have written compelling, insightful stories in The New York Times, Time Magazine, PBS NewsHour, Business Insider, The Hechinger Report and several local news publications across the country. 

I'm passionate about connecting with marginalized communities, giving them the space to be front and center in the media. A people-driven reporter at heart, I've built and sustained relationships with several community members, students, parents and educators in my time as a journalist. I also love flexing my multimedia muscles and creating new tech resources for people who need them. I am a naturally enterprising, passionate networker. 

In my past life, I was a seventh grade Texas history and writing teacher, where I was responsible for trying to coax pre-teens into buying my corny jokes about The Alamo and paragraphs. 

I earned a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University and a bachelor's degree in journalism from Indiana University. While at IU, I minored in Sociology and African American and African Diaspora Studies, which I credit for making me a more socially aware communicator. 

As an outdoorsy L.A. native, I'm always trying to do and learn new things (like skydiving!). I'm an avid roller skater and swimmer. Next on my list to accomplish: Salsa and Bachata dancing. I'm also actively working on speaking Spanish fluently.

I’ve been lucky to continue to find work in an industry I’m passionate about and I continue to tackle every video production, no matter my role, with one overarching philosophy: That it is not the hours that matter, but the final product. A little extra time (or a lot, sometimes) can go a long way in taking a video or photo from good to amazing. I’m always looking for a challenge and love to problem solve.  The skills it shows as my strengths, fit perfectly with video production and leading production crews.

_______________________
I taken the Strength Finders Test, the result of which are below:

The Clifton StrengthsFinder measures the presence of talent in 34 categories called ""themes."" These themes were determined by Gallup as those that most consistently predict outstanding performance. The greater the presence of a theme of talent within a person, the more likely that person is to spontaneously exhibit those talents in day-to-day behaviors. Focusing on naturally powerful talents helps people use them as the foundation of strengths and enjoy personal, academic, and career success through consistent, near-perfect performance.

Below are my top five themes of talent, ranked in the order revealed by my responses to the Clifton StrengthsFinder.

Restorative
People who are especially talented in the Restorative theme are adept at dealing with problems. They are good at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it.

Relator
People who are especially talented in the Relator theme enjoy close relationships with others. They find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.

Intellection
People who are especially talented in the Intellection theme are characterized by their intellectual activity. They are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions.

Strategic
People who are especially talented in the Strategic theme create alternative ways to proceed. Faced with any given scenario, they can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues.

Responsibility
People who are especially talented in the Responsibility theme take psychological ownership of what they say they will do. They are committed to stable values such as honesty and loyalty.",2.0493150684931507,Small Business Owner,Business,,

In short, my professional passion is to create growth through marketing. I believe that every marketer - no mater what business area or role - has to be creative. But at the very end it is only measurable business results that justifies our professional existence.

The best starting point for all communication is that no-one is interested in your company nor the brand behind your possibly great products. To attract, engage and finally sell, you must first evoke emotions, then give reasons and finally redeem all expectations you’ve set in every encounter and touchpoint . That’s why strategic marketing planning should always to start with a question of ”why”.

My journey as a college student didn't start off as a Computer Science major but fate landed me in an ""Introduction to Python Programming for Non-major"" class in my Freshmen year. Every time I used to sit in the class time used to pass away so quickly and I enjoyed every minute of it. My professor was amazing and she made learning everything seem so simple. That's when I decided to make the big shift. The journey so far had been extremely challenging but I would trade it for nothing.

As a CS major in my junior year, I am extremely passionate about analyzing and interpreting large data sets and use my results to develop solutions to challenging problems.

I am looking for urban/sub-urban area positions in Austin, Atlanta, Boston, Denver, or Seattle with a smaller commute time and flexible work hours.  

Currently, I'm growing in a leadership capacity as a Test Team Lead for a group of 8 Test Engineers.
* I interpret complex requirements and provide guidance, direction, and feedback to the team on test procedure development, execution, and troubleshooting.
* Additionally I plan and develop extensive, formal test plans for both component and system test efforts.

Historically I worked as a Full-Stack Software Engineer on several web-app projects.
* My passion is for front-end software development using Angular, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create streamlined user experiences that target the client's needs and expectations.

Additional Notes: I am also interested in taking a look outside the DoD sector into the private industry where there is more freedom for creativity and the ability to use new technologies.  I also believe I can decipher requests from non-technical clientele well and build out beautiful and functional designs using sound architecture principles.  I have a strong degree of empathy to work well with a variety of personalities to see a problem from other people's points of view.  As such I would also be interested in exploring small team lead positions.

A feature flag is a conditional code statement placed into your code that can toggle a feature on or off. 

In LaunchDarkly, this is combined with a U.I. that helps you incrementally control/separate code deployment from release. This lets you test in production, A/B/n test functionality, and embrace hypothesis-driven development through experimentation. 

Many organizations also use our UI to help manage technical debt that accumulates with development. 

Atlassian, Microsoft, HashiCorp, BNZ, and others use us to deliver software daily and can within 200 milliseconds turn off misbehaving functions if bad code is released.

This decision resulted in also further exposing myself to programming languages such as C and C++, which tied up the three engineering disciplines I found the most interesting.

I am a savvy, conceptual thinker with a proven record of driving revenue gains and brand awareness through the power of compelling creative and data-driven user strategy.  I've built countless websites, blogs, and social media campaigns from the ground up. Throughout my career, I utilize a holistic understanding of all forms of inbound marketing; from presenting ambitious KPI goals to my clients, to execution, ROI tracking, CRM management, and building upon success with aggressive split testing and optimization. 
 
I graduated from the SCAD’s Communication Arts program with Magna Cum Laude honors. I was hired by Chong + Koster in Washington, DC where I worked on digital marketing campaigns for over 10+ victorious U.S. Senator’s Election Campaigns, nonprofit organizations, and major corporate brands. 
 
In 2015,  I moved to Los Angeles and founded Beattie Cole Digital Marketing Agency. As a full-stack agency, the company goal was to optimize the digital footprint of over 20 companies. Through the maximization of digital tools, I ensured their voices were being heard by the audiences they needed.

Now I live in Nashville, Tennessee where I served two roles leading marketing departments as Chief Marketing Officer. At MONQ, I lead the company's largest department which oversaw the company's paid acquisition, content marketing, PR, CRM, SEO, social media, and influencer marketing departments. I maximized revenue and oversaw a record shattering Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend for the company. We drove enough demand to completely sell out their sequel product, MONQ R, within a week of launch. As CMO of Whiteblock, my mission was to drive demand for the launch of a first-of-its-kind blockchain based software product. I leveraged content marketing, social media, and lead generation to drive hundreds of niche users to the product on its first day of launch.
   
I like to call myself a communications optimizer. After all, isn’t communication the foundation of any successful relationship? What relationship is more important to your business than the one you share with your customer? Whatever that might be, I am here to help you optimize it.",4.3863013698630136,Chief Marketing Officer,Business,,

My exploration into the world of entrepreneurship began after receiving my BA in Psychology in 2014 and spending the following six years playing professional baseball. Not long into my journey through professional sports, I realized a glamorous life of being highly compensated and pampered was not in the cards for me.

So I quickly embarked upon a parallel journey to find ways to create income streams that would allow me to maintain my main focus of developing as a professional baseball player. 

Little did I know this would actually spark a whole new area of interest for me outside of baseball; I became obsessed with finding new ways to create income in the most efficient and optimized ways possible. 

By always looking for cashflow, having a disciplined routine, and practicing learning as a never-ending process, I remain the sole person in control of how, where, and with whom I spend my time.

I don't want to drudge on for too long here, so please feel reach out to me anytime to talk more about lifestyle entrepreneurship (or anything business-related, really!).",1.797260273972603,Senior Business Growth Strategist,Business,,

- Resilient to failures - if a catastrophic failure is unavoidable, then it should fail gracefully and be monitor-able
- Testable and tested, through unit, integration, and manual testing
- Simple and maintainable, following SOLID principles
- Aware and contains or defines its external dependencies
- Documented for its users, creators, and maintainers

My curiosity, empathy, and analytical approach to life followed me from childhood into adulthood. My time at VT & NSS fostered these character traits and gave me a desire to utilize these traits in the professional world. 

After graduating from VT, I found a job in healthcare doing hands-on patient care as a CNA. Working with people that needed help to do almost everything fulfilled my desire to be compassionate & empathetic and provided me with a sense of purpose. 

Four years later, curiosity propelled me to pursue a path that would fulfill my desire to understand how things work. I became a commercial/residential plumber; within 6 months of starting, I was promoted from helper to technician and was sent into the field with the expectation of solving plumbing issues on my own. I utilized my knowledge and analytical approach to give the customer the best service I could provide. As much as I enjoyed my time as a plumber, I found myself craving a more dynamic challenge; I needed to fulfill my curiosity and analytical mindset.

I was first introduced to programming one night a few years ago using StumbeUpon. It brought me to CodeAcademy. I found myself staying up way too late learning about this world completely new to me.  Studying programming became a hobby; it remained in my mind and eventually drove me to pursue a career in software development. 

I discovered Nashville Software School and found it to be a place where my analytical approach and curiosity is continually fulfilled and reignited everyday. NSS also became a place where I can practice empathy with my classmates by learning their perspectives, being a trustworthy, helpful teammate, and showing attention and understanding. I have no doubt this path I chose will be anything but challenging and fulfilling providing me with the best opportunity to utilize and grow my character traits.",3.5863013698630137,Full Stack Developer,Tech,,

My skills range from HTML and CSS to JavaScript, as well as typography, color theory and logo design. These skills have enhanced my background, which includes journalism, advertising, and marketing.

I also have a background in sales. I sold Xerox copy machines for several years at XESI Document Solutions. In those years, I have helped many clients with their document management problems, from large print shops, to small, family owned businesses.

I graduated from the University of Wyoming in December of 2012 with a degree in Journalism & Advertising and a minor in Marketing Communications.

I have experience building mobile applications, mostly developing back-end services for the projects like the Sprint Football Live (NFL) app, NASCAR Sprint Cup Mobile app and the NBA 2 Go app. I've also developed privacy preserving authentication/authorization applications where I created a SAML Identity Provider (IDP) which was used by customers to quickly integrate their systems with our ""Trust Network"" A&A app, while also implementing diverse authentication technologies from Facial recognition (utilizing ShuftiPro) to WebAuthn or U2F, and many, many more. I'm more productive as a back-end developer because of my mediocre graphic design skills but if there are design specs available I can turn them into functioning user interfaces.

Todavía recuerdo mi primer contacto con ""uno"", en casa de un vecino, jugando al Trivial Pursuit en su Amiga.
Mientras jugaba todos y cada uno de los juegos que tenía mi vecino, me di cuenta de que el inglés sería una herramienta totalmente necesaria si alguna vez quería trabajar con ordenadores.
Cuando me di cuenta de que podría aprenderlo por mi cuenta, entendí que no debería ser sólo eso lo que aprendiese por mi cuenta, así que me puse manos a la obra para aprender otras ""skills"" que me ayudasen. 
No tuve la oportunidad de ir a la universidad pero me las he arreglado para aprender lo suficiente para poder relacionarme de igual a igual con la gente de este mundillo.
Si me lo puedo permitir, todos los días intentaré aprender un poquito de algo, lo que sea.
Aquel jovenzuelo queda ya muy lejos, hoy soy otro tipo de persona, igual de inquieta y con el mismo afán por aprender pero mucho más comprometido, perfeccionista, minucioso, entregado, dedicado, buen compañero y, por supuesto, humilde (menudo lugar para poner este adjetivo, ¿a que sí? Pero es la verdad).

Me gusta trabajar como me gusta tratar a las personas, de forma sincera y honesta. Esto hace que mi interlocutor se sienta lo suficientemente cómodo como para permitirme ayudarle con sus problemas.

He pasado por muchos puestos técnicos a lo largo de mi carrera, soporte, customer success, analista, etc. 

Todo lo anterior me permite:
- Basar mis decisiones en datos sin dejar de lado el instinto.
- Saber que el cliente o usuario es el centro de mi trabajo.
- Hacer que su satisfacción sea mi satisfacción y sus victorias mis victorias.
- Llegar a conclusiones usando un idioma técnico o ejecutivo e informar a los usuarios o clientes en su mismo lenguaje para que entiendan y aprendan un poquillo si les apetece.
- Ser un remanso de paz cuando llega la adversidad, que siempre llega.
- Prestar especial atención al detalle (Tantísimo que he conseguido convertirlo en mi hobby).
- Entender que no hay tecnología fuera de mi alcance.
- Dominar cualquier cosa que quiera hacer.
- Tomar decisiones creativas.
- Trabajar todos y cada uno de los días con una sonrisa e intentar que quien me rodea se sienta igual.

Mis especialidades son:
- Soporte.
- Customer Success.
- Product Owner/Manager.
- Team building.",1.8821917808219175,Business Analyst,Business,,

I’m passionate about technology that truly helps humanity move forward, such as innovations related to energy, IoT device integration, AI, and machine learning.

My sales are founded on relationships of trust with my customers. A genuine customer advocate who has successfully represented the voice of the customer within my organization, I am unafraid to push for the long-term best interests of both my organization and the customer.  For example, I turned around the faltering Mexican operations of Operational Technology Integrators (A Building IoT Company) by transforming negative customer experiences into opportunities to demonstrate our commitment to customer success. In one instance, a customer was threatening to take their business elsewhere; I listened intently, analyze the customer’s root concerns, and thoroughly addressed their issues to clean the slate. The result? A relationship saved and $250K in new managed service contracts!

Recently, I joined Conviva, a company specializing in delivering meaningful insights through analytics to optimize user experiences for streaming video businesses. As Strategic Account Manager, I’m working collaboratively to advance the organization’s market share and elevate customer experiences throughout North America and LATAM.

My collaboration approach includes finding connection points with team members and customers across all levels and functions to build rapport, earn trust, and gain an intimate understanding of an organization through the eyes of its people. I take this macro level approach to identify what a business/institution is dealing with and how that plays into the larger picture of its mission, so I can deliver specialized knowledge and open new perspectives around government and security topics.  

From working with cross-cultural teams to understanding the geopolitical climate of various regions, the work I do is inherently global in nature and I believe joining forces with people of varying backgrounds, viewpoints, and areas of expertise is a catalyst to real game-changing innovation and impact.  

I consider my recent selection as a Class of 2021 Presidential Innovation Fellow the culmination of my career success. As an “entrepreneur in residence” for one year, I was chosen for executive-level expertise, innovation, influence, and problem-solving dexterity. I am honored to be part of a group of industry and government thought leaders trusted to strategize solutions to the nation’s toughest challenges and improve the lives of the public.",2.0493150684931507,"Director, Government Security Programs",Politics,,

I also worked with forwarding information within the pipeline itself to boost processor performance by shortening instruction processing time that use the processors critical path.
