With this dual-sided view, I help both start-up and larger companies work effectively with the government, build proper organizational structure, achieve security clearance, and anticipate future hurdles. On the other side, government partners trust my ability to recognize their uniquely positioned issues and take the lead in devising and executing complex strategy, so they can focus on the daily tactics of their critical roles.

My collaboration approach includes finding connection points with team members and customers across all levels and functions to build rapport, earn trust, and gain an intimate understanding of an organization through the eyes of its people. I take this macro level approach to identify what a business/institution is dealing with and how that plays into the larger picture of its mission, so I can deliver specialized knowledge and open new perspectives around government and security topics.  

From working with cross-cultural teams to understanding the geopolitical climate of various regions, the work I do is inherently global in nature and I believe joining forces with people of varying backgrounds, viewpoints, and areas of expertise is a catalyst to real game-changing innovation and impact.

Todavía recuerdo mi primer contacto con ""uno"", en casa de un vecino, jugando al Trivial Pursuit en su Amiga.
Mientras jugaba todos y cada uno de los juegos que tenía mi vecino, me di cuenta de que el inglés sería una herramienta totalmente necesaria si alguna vez quería trabajar con ordenadores.
Cuando me di cuenta de que podría aprenderlo por mi cuenta, entendí que no debería ser sólo eso lo que aprendiese por mi cuenta, así que me puse manos a la obra para aprender otras ""skills"" que me ayudasen. 
No tuve la oportunidad de ir a la universidad pero me las he arreglado para aprender lo suficiente para poder relacionarme de igual a igual con la gente de este mundillo.
Si me lo puedo permitir, todos los días intentaré aprender un poquito de algo, lo que sea.
Aquel jovenzuelo queda ya muy lejos, hoy soy otro tipo de persona, igual de inquieta y con el mismo afán por aprender pero mucho más comprometido, perfeccionista, minucioso, entregado, dedicado, buen compañero y, por supuesto, humilde (menudo lugar para poner este adjetivo, ¿a que sí? Pero es la verdad).

Me gusta trabajar como me gusta tratar a las personas, de forma sincera y honesta. Esto hace que mi interlocutor se sienta lo suficientemente cómodo como para permitirme ayudarle con sus problemas.

He pasado por muchos puestos técnicos a lo largo de mi carrera, soporte, customer success, analista, etc. 

Todo lo anterior me permite:
- Basar mis decisiones en datos sin dejar de lado el instinto.
- Saber que el cliente o usuario es el centro de mi trabajo.
- Hacer que su satisfacción sea mi satisfacción y sus victorias mis victorias.
- Llegar a conclusiones usando un idioma técnico o ejecutivo e informar a los usuarios o clientes en su mismo lenguaje para que entiendan y aprendan un poquillo si les apetece.
- Ser un remanso de paz cuando llega la adversidad, que siempre llega.
- Prestar especial atención al detalle (Tantísimo que he conseguido convertirlo en mi hobby).
- Entender que no hay tecnología fuera de mi alcance.
- Dominar cualquier cosa que quiera hacer.
- Tomar decisiones creativas.
- Trabajar todos y cada uno de los días con una sonrisa e intentar que quien me rodea se sienta igual.

Mis especialidades son:
- Soporte.
- Customer Success.
- Product Owner/Manager.
- Team building.",1.8821917808219173,Business Analyst,Business,,

Healthcare is an ever-changing field in which we are constantly learning new things. In my opinion, it is one of the beauties of the field itself. Alongside the continuous learning, a big motivator for me is building personal relationships with patients along with coworkers in the hospital setting.

From my experience, I know that most of these patients may not have much going for them or they may be in a tough spot in life. No matter their position, it is the responsibility of a healthcare professional to make them feel as if they have come to a safe place where they will be catered to and looked after 100%. Those relationships are extremely valuable to me and that is the main reason why I want to serve others in healthcare.

Although I plan on going into the administrative side of healthcare instead of the medical, I believe that I can still touch the patients’ lives through proper staffing and policies. I want to get to a top executive position one day and build a team full of caring people whom I know will serve our patients to their every need.

Healthcare should not be looked at as a business but unfortunately, money is held above peoples’ lives. I understand that this is easier said than done but hopefully my generation and the coming generations will take steps in order to approach healthcare with care first rather than money or other incentives.",2.1315068493150684,Social Media Business Strategist,Business,Media & News,

Film Endeavors:
Aamir is currently working on a film script that is centered around the lifestyles of troubled youth, yet focuses on unexpected, but positive outcomes.   

The Musical Approach:
Skrill Gates focuses his lyrics on the realities of life in the streets versus the over sensationalized façade of the entertainment industry. His music documents the untold stories of young men growing up in the ghetto and the choices they are required to make to survive. Although Skrill Gates has worked with many established artists and producers such as Aaron Carter, he prefers to allow his “Reality Music” sound to speak for itself. 

Community Ties:
With his program, Project A.A.M.I.R., he seeks to touch the lives of young men in crisis who need support and skill development with managing anger, overcoming negative self-esteem, racism, and peer pressure. Aamir's approach to counseling uses real life situations and examples, which can sufficiently build the skills needed to survive in a society that seeks to solve the issue of troubled adolescents with incarceration.",18.312328767123287,Artist/Partner,Entertainment,,

I was lucky enough to be able to return to my previous profession as a puppet fabrication coordinator in the stop motion film industry. Originally hired as a consultant to develop a tracking system for puppet assets as they traveled between fabricators during lockdown, I was eventually hired on full-time to implement the system as the production returned to in-studio work. As the pandemic began to ease, I imagined my band would begin touring again, but the delta variant had other ideas, so I am back on the market looking for job opportunities in stop-motion production as a coordinator.

My job is to ensure the team achieves all project deliverables and to fill any gaps along the way. My duties evolve throughout the Product Development cycle up until the first car rolls off the plant. These duties include target setting, benchmarking, sourcing, testing and launching 

Dealing with a complex product, I need to drive cross-functional issue resolution, escalate issues to management, all with the intention to launch the vehicle on time. This position has allowed me to see the bigger picture and appreciate the hundreds of work streams working tirelessly to conceptualize/ commercialize a marvelous engineered product.

In 2015, I received my Mechanical Engineering degree from the University of Waterloo. I also have over three years of internship and full-time work experience, covering various industries. Through these diverse experiences, I’ve had the opportunity to be a guest of Louisiana’s Southern Hospitality and the frigid winters of Northern Ontario.  I’ve always seen work as a means to travel, allowing me to satisfy my adventurous spirit. Currently, I’m on a quest to visit all the Wonders of World (two down, five more to go!)

I’m always interested in hearing from former colleagues, managers or just interesting creative folk, so feel free to contact me if you’d like to connect
